        <p class="quote">&raquo;&nbsp;This course was eye and heart opening. Eva explains filmmaking as a making way of storytelling whilst also focussing on the practicalities. It gave me a fresh momentum to structure my ideas and provided me with a great foundation for independent filmmaking.&nbsp;&laquo;</p>
