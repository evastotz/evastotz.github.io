        <p class="quote">&raquo;&nbsp;When registering for the class I wasn’t sure whether this would work: Shoot and edit a documentary short in the class and at night. But Eva just knows how to guide people to very close to their full potential. Eva, you really made us create things and go beyond what we thought we could do. Thank you for this.&nbsp;&laquo;</p>
