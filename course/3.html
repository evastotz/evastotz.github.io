        <p class="quote">&raquo;&nbsp;Your course helped me see the world around me in filmic terms. Your careful attention to the details in every shot of my exercises showed me how important every image is in telling a story. You taught me to create an emotional space with my films rather than just giving information.&nbsp;&laquo;</p>
