    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p id="description" class="large-block">'Labour in a Single Shot' is a project that Antje Ehmann and Harun Farocki started in 2011. They have initiated video production workshops in 15 cities worldwide followed by a series of exhibitions that  shows selected workshop results in a larger context.
Since 2017 Eva Stotz continues those workshops, starting in Juin 2017 in Vilnius, Lithuania. Continuing  together with Antje Ehmann in March 2018 in Marseille, France, September 2019 in Chicago, USA, 2020 in Bogota, Columbia and Shanghai, China.
The task of the workshops is to produce videos of 1 to 2 minutes in length, each taken in a single shot. The camera can be static, panning or travelling – only cuts are not allowed. The subject of investigation is ‘labour’. More here: http://www.labour-in-a-single-shot.net</p>

        <p class="quote">&raquo;&nbsp;It was such a pleasure to work with you: not only I learned a lot of new things, but most importantly you taught us that practice is the most crucial thing. You must have super powers to handle so many different things during this workshop (giving lectures, visiting places and making the most inspiring videos, consulting us etc.). In the course I met so many different people and I&#39;m happy as never before!&nbsp;&laquo;</p>
